## Run the System with docker
We can easily run the whole with only a single command:
```bash
docker-compose up
```

We can easil run the app with cloud DB with 
```bash
sudo docker-compose -f docker-compose.staging.yml up -d --build
```

Docker will pull the MySQL and Node.js images (if our machine does not have it before).

The services can be run on the background with command:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
## Stop the System with docker
Stopping all the running containers is also simple with a single command:
```bash
docker-compose down
```

## Insight the System with docker
List all docker contaoners
```bash
docker ps
```

Stop a docker contaoner
```bash
docker stop {container-id}
```

Remove a docker contaoner
```bash
docker rm {container-id}
```
